This is a Big mart sales prediction project where we will try to predict the number of sales in a store using paramtres like
fat content,Item weight etc

Here We have test and train data.We will seprate the test data in 2 parts X_train,Y_train and X_test,Y_test.

We will implement 2 different machine learning supervised learning algorihtms:-
1:-Linear regresssion
2:-Random Forest
